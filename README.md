                                    Title: Profitable Trip planning Assistant in US from JFK-New York


Project Proposal:
    
    In this project I would like to create a web application that suggest the best time to plan the trip based on the activity the user planning to do at any destination in US and would simulate various models for forecasting the future air fares and classifying whether to buy or wait for the reduction in air ticket fare based on historical trends.

Aim of the project:
  
  Input from the user:
    
    US Destination: where to go
    Travel start date : departure date  
    Trip activity - eg: skiing, trekking, relaxing, scuba diving etc

  Output:
   
    Weather condition of the destination
    Suggest best time (month) of the year to visit the destination
    List of destination you could also consider to travel on mentioned dates
    Current air fares if you book immediately
    Suggest the user to wait for to book ticket due to probability of  price down in the future

To do list:

     Create a GUI using Tkinter
     Data collection: 
       Using scrapy web crawling framework to get data in csv database
       Explore data collection automation techniques 
     Data Preprocessing:
       Using pandas to do exploratory analysis of data
     Data Preparation: 
       Analyze data distribution
       Extract required features - using Scikit-learn library
     Predictive model building using algorithms to forecast airfare drop 
       Explore ways to suggest the day to book the flight in cheaper rate
